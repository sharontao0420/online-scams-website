# online-scams-webstie

HTML/CSS, flexbox, media-query, 960 Grid, Bootstrap for the design layout of the website;

Figma/Adobe suites for designing how the website looks like.

To follow the standard website rule, there's a "Home" page, a "About Us" page, and three main pages of content that corresponding to our sub topics. We separate the content on the site to different sections as below:

- Types of Online Scams

- Targeted Demographics

- How to recognize and avoid scams

I decided to use multiple methods to build the website. To keep the consistency of our "Home" page and the first topic "Types of Online Scams" page, I applied the same theme with changing and tweaking of images and content. Under "Types of Online Scams" section, I created four individual pages covering four types of online scams including Spoofing, Phishing, Malware/Ransomware and Social Engineering. The Bootstrap technique is applied in all of the sites includes the build-in components such as Dropdown menu , and dropbown links, Carousel(A slideshow component for cycling through elements—images or slides of text), Jumbotron (Lightweight, flexible component for showcasing hero unit style content.)

The 960 Grid System is an effort to streamline web development workflow by providing commonly used dimensions, based on a width of 960 pixels. There are two variants: 12 and 16 columns, which can be used separately or in tandem.The 12-column grid is divided into portions that are 60 pixels wide. The 16-column grid consists of 40 pixel increments. Each column has 10 pixels of margin on the left and right, which create 20 pixel wide gutters between columns

It’s super flexible when it comes to arrange layout of the website just as its name indicates. The Flexbox Layout aims at providing a more efficient way to lay out, align and distribute space among items in a container, even when their size is unknown and/or dynamic. The main idea behind the flex layout is to give the container the ability to change its items’ width/height (and order) to best fill the available space. Most importantly, the flexbox layout is direction-agnostic as opposed to the regular layouts (block which is vertically-based and inline which is horizontally-based).
