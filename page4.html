            <h2>Why do we need to be aware? </h2>
            <p>Phishing tricks the user into unwittingly handing over their passwords to the scammer, often through
                professional-looking emails purporting to be from trustworthy businesses. This is used to steal personal
                information, like credit card and social security numbers and login credentials. The attacker tricks a
                victim into opening an email, instant message, or text message. The recipient is then tricked into
                clicking a malicious link. An attack can have devastating results. For individuals, this includes
                unauthorized purchases, the stealing of funds, or identify theft.
            </p>

                <h3>Email Phishing Cases</h3>
                <img class="imgPage1" src="image/Untitled-4.png">
                <p>According to the Anti-Phishing Working Group, nearly 100,000 attempts of phishing are reported each
                    month worldwide.
                </p>

                <p>Email phishing is a numbers game. An attacker sending out thousands of fraudulent messages can net
                    significant information and sums of money, even if only a small percentage of recipients fall for
                    the scam. Attackers design phishing messages to mimic actual emails from a spoofed organization.
                    Using the same phrasing, typefaces, logos, and signatures makes the messages appear legitimate.
                    Lastly, links inside messages resemble their legitimate counterparts, but typically have a
                    misspelled domain name or extra subdomains. Phishers have sometimes used images instead of text to
                    make it harder for anti-phishing filters to detect the text commonly used in phishing emails.

                </p>
                <p> The availability of phishing kits makes it easy for cyber criminals, even those with minimal
                    technical skills, to launch phishing campaigns. A phishing kit bundles phishing website resources
                    and tools that need only be installed on a server. These resources include pre-generated HTML pages
                    and emails for popular banks and online commerce sites, scripts for processing user input, email and
                    proxy server lists, and even hosting services for phishing sites.
                    Once installed, all the attacker needs to do is send out emails to potential victims. Phishing kits
                    as well as mailing lists are available on the dark web. A couple of sites, Phishtank and OpenPhish,
                    keep crowd-sourced lists of known phishing kits.

                </p>

                <h3>Technical Strategies: </h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>One of the simplest techniques for obscuring the actual destination of a hyperlink is to use
                            a legitimate URL within an anchor element but have its href attribute point to a malicious
                            site. Thus clicking on a legitimate-looking URL actually sends the user to a phishing site.
                            This deception can be detected because web browsers display the actual destination of a
                            hyperlink when a user moves the mouse pointer over the link; this information is typically
                            displayed in the web browser’s status bar.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Use of JPEG images: Electronic mail rendered in HTML format is becoming more prevalent.
                            Phishers are taking advantage of this by constructing phishing emails that contain a single
                            image in JPEG format. When displayed, this image appears to be legitimate email from an
                            online bank or merchant site. The image often includes official logos and text to add to the
                            deception. However, when users click on this image, they are directed to a phishing site.
                            Phishing emails using this technique can often be detected by observing the actual
                            destination URL when mousing over the image.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Use of alternate encoding schemes: Hostnames and IP addresses can be represented in alternate
                            formats that are less likely to be recognizable to most people.</p>
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <div class="img5Page4">
                    <img src="image/Untitled-5.png" width="350px">
                </div>
                <p>Applying a sense of urgency and pressure causes the user to be less diligent and more prone to error.
                    Criminals rely on deception and creating a sense of urgency to achieve success with their phishing
                    campaigns. During a crisis, people are on edge. They want information and are looking for direction
                    from their employers, the government, and other relevant authorities. An email that appears to be
                    from one of these entities and promises new information or instructs recipients to complete a task
                    quickly will likely receive less scrutiny than prior to the crisis. An impulsive click later, and
                    the victim's device is infected or account is compromised.

                <ul>
                    <p>one of the most common types of phone scamming involves a caller claiming to be an Internal
                        Revenue Service official and threatening those who answer over supposed debts. According to
                        Experian, these phony IRS agents will call and demand money from victims, threatening arrest or
                        even deportation if they don’t comply.
                    </p>

                    <li>Grandparent Scam</li>
                    <p>Targets older adults by the scammer pretending to be the grandchild and concoct a story ending
                        with a request for immediate financial assistance. Often, tricked seniors will end up sending
                        money via wire transfer to the scammers as a result.
                    </p>
                    <li>Utility-related Scams</li>
                    <p>operate by tricking those who answer their calls into giving out personal and billing information
                        in exchange for the promise of a federal program or the potential to lower the monthly cost of a
                        utility bill. Once they have this information, the criminals can commit identity theft, opening
                        accounts in their victim’s name.
