                    <h3>Spoofing</h3>
                </a>
                <p>"Spoofing" a phone number is a tactic of changing the phone number seen on a caller ID. Companies
                    like Spoofcard allow users to purchase credits towards call time used in a simple smartphone app.
                    Users input the number they want to call, and what number they want displayed on the other end —
                    initiating an untraceable call that leaves the other person only seeing the spoofed caller ID. For a
                    hacker trying to gain access to someone's online accounts, spoofing the call number is just step one
                    in a social engineering play to convince a customer service representative they are legitimate. The
                    FCC only prohibits someone from using a misleading caller ID number if their intent is to defraud,
                    cause harm, or obtain anything of value. Under this law, if there is no intent to harm, you can use
                    other numbers.</p>

                    <h3>Phishing</h3>
                </a>
                <p>Phishing tricks the user into unwittingly handing over their passwords to the scammer, often through
                    professional-looking emails purporting to be from trustworthy businesses. This is used to steal
                    personal information, like credit card and social security numbers and login credentials. The
                    attacker tricks a victim into opening an email, instant message, or text message. The recipient is
                    then tricked into clicking a malicious link. An attack can have devastating results. For
                    individuals, this includes unauthorized purchases, the stealing of funds, or identify theft.

                    <h3>Malware/Ransomware</h3>
                </a>
                <p>Ransomware is malware designed to deny a user or organization access to files on their computer. By
                    encrypting these files and demanding a ransom payment for the decryption key, these malware place
                    organizations in a position where paying the ransom is the easiest and cheapest way to regain access
                    to their files.

                    <h3>Social Engineering</h3>
                </a>
                <p>Social engineering is the art of manipulating people so they give up confidential information such as
                    passwords or bank information. These scams tend to lure unsuspecting users into exposing data,
                    spreading malware infections, or giving access to restricted systems. Criminals use social
                    engineering tactics because it is usually easier to exploit your natural inclination to trust than
                    it is to discover ways to hack your software. Scams based on social engineering are built around how
                    people think and act. Once an attacker understands what motivates a user’s actions, they can deceive
                    and manipulate the user effectively. Most social engineering attacks rely on actual communication
                    between attackers and victims. The attacker tends to motivate the user into compromising themselves,
                    rather than using brute force methods to breach your data.
