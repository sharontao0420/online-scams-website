                    <h3>What the purpose of the project and why it interests your group?
                    </h3>
                </a>
                <p>The purpose of our project is to discuss different types of online scams, explain what tools and
                    technologies are used for them (Williams, Emma J., and Danielle Polage, 184), and define which
                    demographics are the most actively targeted and therefore affected. We hope this website provides
                    helpful information for people who are worried about falling victim to online scams and gives
                    insight into how they work and what to look out for in relation to privacy concerns and privacy
                    protection behaviors. For individuals, some of the most common times of online scams include E-Mail
                    Account Compromise, Phishing/Spoofing, and Malware/Scareware/Ransomware (Internet Fraud — FBI). This
                    issue interests our group as it has become increasingly important because “as individuals become
                    more dependent on online services, such as e-shopping, e-government, online meetings, and various
                    other forms of inter-personal interaction, they also become vulnerable to online fraud.” This has
                    become even more common throughout the COVID-19 pandemic (H. Abroshan, J. Devos, G. Poels and E.
                    Laermans).

                    <h3>What technologies you use? i.e. HTML/CSS, Wordpress, etc.;
                    </h3>
                </a>
                <p> HTML/CSS, flexbox, media-query, 960 Grid, Bootstrap for the design layout of the
                    website; </p>

                <p>
                    Figma/Adobe suites for designing how the website looks like.

                </p>

                <p>
                    To follow the standard website rule, there's a "Home" page, a "About Us" page, and three main pages
                    of content that corresponding to
                    our sub topics.



                    We separate the content on the site to different sections as below: </p>


                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            Types of Online Scams
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            Targeted Demographics </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            How to recognize and avoid scams </p>
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>I decided to use
                    multiple methods to build the website. To keep the consistency of our "Home" page and the first
                    topic "Types of Online Scams" page, I applied the same theme with changing and tweaking of images
                    and
                    content. Under "Types of Online Scams" section, I created four individual pages covering four types of online scams including Spoofing, Phishing, Malware/Ransomware and Social Engineering.
                    The Bootstrap technique is applied in all of the sites includes the build-in components such as
                    <span style="font-weight: bold ;">Dropdown menu </span>, and <span
                        style="font-weight: bold ;">dropbown links</span>, <span
                        style="font-weight: bold ;">Carousel</span>(A slideshow component for cycling through
                    elements—images or slides of text), <span style="font-weight: bold ;">Jumbotron</span> (Lightweight,
                    flexible component for showcasing hero unit style content.)
                </p>

                <p>The 960 Grid System is an effort to streamline web development workflow by providing commonly used
                    dimensions, based on a width of 960 pixels. There are two variants: 12 and 16 columns, which can be
                    used separately or in tandem.The 12-column grid is divided into portions that are 60 pixels wide.
                    The 16-column grid consists of 40 pixel increments. Each column has 10 pixels of margin on the left
                    and right, which create 20 pixel wide gutters between columns</p>

                    <p>It’s super flexible when it comes to arrange layout of the website just as its name indicates. 
                        The Flexbox Layout aims at providing a more efficient way to lay out, align and distribute space among items in a container, even when their size is unknown and/or dynamic.
                        
                        The main idea behind the flex layout is to give the container the ability to change its items’ width/height (and order) to best fill the available space. 
                        
                        Most importantly, the flexbox layout is direction-agnostic as opposed to the regular layouts (block which is vertically-based and inline which is horizontally-based). 
                        </p>

                    <h3>Malware/Ransomware</h3>
                </a>
                <p>Ransomware is malware designed to deny a user or organization access to files on their computer. By
                    encrypting these files and demanding a ransom payment for the decryption key, these malware place
                    organizations in a position where paying the ransom is the easiest and cheapest way to regain access
                    to their files.

                    <h3>Social Engineering</h3>
                </a>
                <p>Social engineering is the art of manipulating people so they give up confidential information such as
                    passwords or bank information. These scams tend to lure unsuspecting users into exposing data,
                    spreading malware infections, or giving access to restricted systems. Criminals use social
                    engineering tactics because it is usually easier to exploit your natural inclination to trust than
                    it is to discover ways to hack your software. Scams based on social engineering are built around how
                    people think and act. Once an attacker understands what motivates a user’s actions, they can deceive
                    and manipulate the user effectively. Most social engineering attacks rely on actual communication
                    between attackers and victims. The attacker tends to motivate the user into compromising themselves,
                    rather than using brute force methods to breach your data.
