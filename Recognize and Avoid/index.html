        <ul>
          <li>The email looks like it’s from a company you may know and trust: Netflix. It even uses a Netflix logo and
            header.

          </li>
          <li>
            The email says your account is on hold because of a billing problem.

          </li>
          <li>
            The email has a generic greeting, “Hi Dear.” If you have an account with the business, it probably wouldn’t
            use a generic greeting like this.
          </li>
          <li>
            The email invites you to click on a link to update your payment details.
          </li>

        <p>



          The scammers who send emails like this one do not have anything to do with the companies they pretend to be.
          Phishing emails can have real consequences for
          people who give scammers their information. And they can harm the reputation of the companies they’re
          spoofing.
        </p>

      <div class="col-sm-6">
        <h2>RULE 1: IF YOU’RE NOT EXPECTING IT, YOU SHOULDN’T ACCEPT IT
          <br>
        </h2>
        <!-- <h5>-- Since Dec 6, 1902 </h5> -->

        <div class="backgroundcolor">
          <p>A standard trick for online scams is to get you to click on a link. This link can show up in an email, a
            hijacked messaging account of one of your friends, a WhatsApp message, or even an SMS. The idea is to direct
            you to a malicious website. Then the scammers will try to download malware onto your device, or trick you
            into revealing your login credentials on a phony website that looks like the real thing.
          </p>

          <p>The best way to combat these scams is to never click on a link you weren’t expecting. If you get an email
            stating that your bank account is about to be frozen or your PayPal email account suddenly needs to be
            validated, don’t click. Even if you check that the email address and the link are leading to the real thing,
            just as a matter of security don’t click. Instead, enter the website address yourself by typing it out in
            the address bar.
          </p>

          <p>Then, once you’ve logged in to the legitimate website, you’ll be able to see if whatever the email claimed
            was real.
          </p>

          <p>Tip: A good way to avoid falling for a phishing website is to use a password manager and its browser
            extension. If you land on a website that isn’t legitimate, then the extension won’t supply your login
            details. Indeed, even if a website has a tricky URL like paypal.com.098uq3409847890. net, it shouldn’t fool
            mainstream password managers.

        <h2>RULE 2: DON’T BUY INTO URGENCY

          <br>
        </h2>
        <!-- <h5>-- Since Dec 6, 1902 </h5> -->



        <div class="backgroundcolor">
          <p>A classic scam is for someone to hijack a person’s Facebook account and then contact all her friends via
            the hijacked account. Often the scammer will claim some kind of emergency, saying your friend is in
            jeopardy, such as “I’m in London. I’ve been robbed, and I have no money.”
          </p>

          <p>When you know this is a scam, you can see where it’s headed. In the moment of urgency, however, it can be
            harder to spot. Of course you want to help your friend: “Oh, my goodness! A foreign country where they might
            end up on the street? I need to help.”

          </p>

          <p>Because an “emergency” is in play, scammers are banking on the likelihood you won’t look too closely at the
            details and instead will just take action. But on your end, you must resist the urge to act immediately. If
            your friend is in dire straits, you can still ask to talk to her on the phone, or verify with someone else
            over the phone that she truly is where she claims to be. The key is to talk to another human being whose
            voice you can recognize, because pretending to be someone else via a text chat is so easy. Do not, however,
            take the word of some “hotel manager” or a supposed good Samaritan who’s speaking on behalf of your friend.

          </p>

          <p>You can apply the same basic principle when it comes to taking immediate action to unfreeze your account.
            First, a bank or credit card company is more likely to call you or send a letter about dramatic action
            rather than drop you a note in Gmail. Nevertheless, if you want to be sure, type in the URL of your bank or
            credit card manually to visit the site. If there is truly a threat to your account, the institution will
            alert you once you log in.

          </p>
        </div>

      </div>

      <div class="col-sm-5 mx-auto">
        <h3>What would you do when scam calls target your client or loved one

          width="450"></a>
        <br>
        <p>Calls from scammers are annoying and can cause a lot of trouble when you realize, too late, that they’re
          scams. What’s even worse? When they target a client or loved one you’re caring for. So today, as part of
          National Family Caregivers Month, we’re talking about how to spot and block scam calls.</p>
        <p>Scammers might pretend to be with the government, a grandchild, tech support, or a potential love interest.
          Listen to this call from a scammer pretending to be with the Social Security Administration:
        </p>
        <p>
          <audio controls>
            <br>
            <source src="//www.consumer.ftc.gov/files/ssa_scam_robocall_2.mp4" type="audio/mpeg">
            <br>

            "Your browser does not support the audio tag."
            <br>
          </audio>
        </p>
        <p>

          The real Social Security Administration won’t threaten people or suspend their Social Security numbers and
          won’t ask for payment this way. It’s a scam.

        <h3>ADVANCED TIP: HOVER OVER LINKS
        </h3>
        <iframe width="405.6" height="228" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/d21-z8wsO7c" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
        <br>
        <p>The next time you get a legitimate email from your bank, try this trick for practice. Hover the cursor over the button or link your bank wants you to click without actually clicking it. Next, look in the lower left corner of your browser window. You should see the web address the link will take you to.
        </p>
        <p>That’s an easy way to spot a scam, because a bad link will never lead to your bank’s website, and scammers will often use a link-shortening service in the attempt to hide that fact.

        </p>
        <p>
          There are a few other things you can watch out for, such as poorly worded emails and chat messages, though this is becoming a less reliable guide in recent years. Another red flag is when someone asks for money in a nontraditional form like a gift card or a cash reload card. Even requests for wiring money can be suspect. The FTC has a good video ( go.pcworld.com/ftcv ) on what to watch out for when being asked for money via the phone or online.

        </p>
        <p>

          The real Social Security Administration won’t threaten people or suspend their Social Security numbers and
          won’t ask for payment this way. It’s a scam.

          <br>
        </h2>
        <!-- <h5>-- Since Dec 6, 1902 </h5> -->



        <div class="backgroundcolor">
          <p>If it’s too good to be true, then it probably is. This may be a cliché, but it’s also a good rule of thumb. Money doesn’t just come tumbling out of your inbox, after all. If a lawyer or business contacts you via email about making a tidy profit on a business transaction or reclaiming some kind of inheritance money, don’t fall for it. This sort of thing just doesn’t happen, no matter how legitimate these offers may seem.
          </p>

          <p>This also goes for online sales. Yes, you can find some fantastic sale prices on Amazon, Best Buy, and other places online. But if you get an email or see a link on social media leading you to an incredible sale price on a site you’ve never heard of, then take a step back. Do some basic research using consumer sites like Trustpilot, Sitejabber, and the Better Business Bureau to see what others have to say about the business. What you’re looking for is overwhelming evidence that the site is legitimate. If you don’t find any information about the site or only a few sparse reviews, that is a huge red flag.

    <h2> How To Report Phishing</h2>
  </div>
</div>

<div class="container" style="margin-top:30px">
  <div class="row">


    <div class="col-sm-6">
      
      <!-- <h5>-- Since Dec 6, 1902 </h5> -->



      <div>
        <p>If you got a phishing email or text message, report it. The information you give can help fight the scammers.


        </p>

        <p>Step 1. If you got a phishing email, forward it to the Anti-Phishing Working Group at reportphishing@apwg.org.


        </p>

        <p>If you got a phishing text message, forward it to SPAM (7726).


        </p>

        <p>Step 2. Report the phishing attack to the FTC at ReportFraud.ftc.gov.


        </p>
        <p>Both AT&T and Verizon have apps that provide spam screening or fraud warnings, although they may cost you extra each month. T-Mobile warns customers if a call is likely a scam when it appears on your phone screen, and you can sign up for a scam blocking service for free.

        </p>
        <p>There are also third-party apps such as RoboKiller and Nomorobo that you can download to help you screen calls, but you should be aware that you will be sharing private data with them.
        </p>
      </div>

    </div>

    <div class="col-sm-6 mx-auto">
      
      <p>After registering for the Do Not Call Registry and checking out your carrier’s options, be very cautious when it comes to sharing your contact information. If an online form asks for your phone number but does not need it, leave that field blank. Also, avoid listing your personal phone number on your social media profiles.
      </p>
      <p>If you receive a call from an unrecognized number, do not answer it. You can always return the call later to see if it was a real person or company. If it was a scam call, you can choose to block the number in your phone, but that too can be frustrating since scammers change their numbers so often.

      </p>
      <p>
        Read the privacy policy on every new service you sign up for to make sure that they will not share or sell your contact information.

      </p>
      <p>

        Be wary of entering contests and sweepstakes online, since they often share data with other companies.

      </p>
      <p>Stay up-to-date on the latest scams, so you know what to look out for, and install mobile security on your phone to help protect you from malware and other threats.
