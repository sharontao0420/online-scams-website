    </div>
    
    <div class="col-sm-10 mx-auto text-left mb-5">
      <p>For our project we chose to research types of online scams. We chose this topic due to the prevalence of online scams and how they have continued to escalate, becoming more devious and convincing with the introduction of new software programs as well as the necessity today of participating and engaging with the online world. This issue addresses topics we have covered in class over the semester, such as online privacy and technological literacy. Our project spans the different approaches used to execute online scams, who the primary targets are and why, and how to establish proper protection from falling victim. 
      </p>

      <p>Overall, the website utilizes the technology of HTML/CSS, flexbox, media-query, 960 Grid and Bootstrap for the design layout of the website. Figma/Adobe suites were used for designing how the website looks. To follow the standard website rule, there is a "Home" page, an "About Us" page, and three main pages of content that correspond to our subtopics. The website is built using multiple methods. To keep the consistency of our "Home" page and the first topic "Types of Online Scams" page, the same theme was applied with some changing and tweaking of images and content. Under the "Types of Online Scams” section, there are four individual pages covering types of online scams including Spoofing, Phishing, Malware/Ransomware and Social Engineering. The Bootstrap technique is applied on all of the sites, including the built-in components such as a dropdown menu and dropdown links using Carousel and Jumbotron. The 960 Grid System is an effort to streamline web development workflow by providing commonly used dimensions, based on a width of 960 pixels. This was used to build out the second topic, demographics and US statistics of online scams. The 12-column grid is divided into portions that are 60 pixels wide, utilizing different widths of containers such as column 5 and column 7 as long as two added columns equals to 12. What’s more, it’s super flexible when it comes to arranging the layout of the website just as its name indicates. The main idea behind the flex layout is to give the container the ability to change its items’ width/height to best fill the available space. The first page and the following sub pages mainly used flexbox to arrange the sections and elements on the pages. 
      </p>

      <p>The page on types of scams outlines the most common techniques used in implementing online scams through email and phone calls. These include spoofing, phishing, and ransomware/malware. The page covers how each of these approaches are utilized and gives examples of them in action. Our next page covers the demographics of who is most likely to be targeted by online scammers and who most commonly falls victim. Our findings show that the elderly (defined as over the age of 60) are primary targets as they are seen as people with significant financial resources as well as a lack of certain media and online literacy skills. The final page outlines ways to avoid online scams and what means of protection can be implemented to keep them at bay.</p>

      <p>When it comes to the process, we discussed and agreed upon the different components of the site and divided up research responsibilities. During the developing process, it’s normal to encounter bugs, questions and confusions. Fortunately, they were solved with the help of research online and through peers. There’s one thing worth mentioning, when it came to really visualizing the outcome of our research on the website, there were gaps between goals and realities of group work. There could have been more effective communication within the group for this project. If it’s an industry case, the functionality of agile design should be exerted to the most which means for example, a review on the problem and research together and a review on the visual and coding standards. However I think currently there’s a lot of lack of professionalism like this.
