            <h2>What is Malware/Ransomware? </h2>
            <p>Ransomware is malware designed to deny a user or organization access to files on their computer. By
                encrypting these files and demanding a ransom payment for the decryption key, these malware place
                organizations in a position where paying the ransom is the easiest and cheapest way to regain access to
                their files.

            </p>

                <h3>Approaches: </h3>

                <h4 class="titleH4">Step one: Infection and Distribution Vectors
                </h4>
                <ol class="titleH4">
                    <li style="color:seagreen">
                        <p>Phishing emails: A malicious email may contain a link to a website hosting a malicious
                            download or an attachment that has downloader functionality built in. If the email recipient
                            falls for the phish, then the ransomware is downloaded and executed on their computer.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP). With RDP, an attacker who has stolen or guessed an employee’s
                            login credentials can use them to authenticate to and remotely access a computer within the
                            enterprise network. With this access, the attacker can directly download the malware and
                            execute it on the machine under their control.

                        </p>
                    </li>

                </ol>

                <h4 class="titleH4">Step two: Data Encryption
                </h4>
                <ul class="titleH4">
                    <li>
                        <p> After ransomware has gained access to a system, it can begin encrypting its files. Since
                            encryption functionality is built into an operating system, this simply involves accessing
                            files, encrypting them with an attacker-controlled key, and replacing the originals with the
                            encrypted versions. Most ransomware variants are cautious in their selection of files to
                            encrypt to ensure system stability. Some variants will also take steps to delete backup and
                            shadow copies of files to make recovery without the decryption key more difficult.</p>
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h4 class="titleH4">Step three: Ransom Demand</h4>
                <ul class="titleH4">
                    <li>
                        <p>Once file encryption is complete, the ransomware is prepared to make a ransom demand.
                            Different ransomware variants implement this in numerous ways, but it is not uncommon to
                            have a display background changed to a ransom note or text files placed in each encrypted
                            directory containing the ransom note. Typically, these notes demand a set amount of
                            cryptocurrency in exchange for access to the victim’s files. If the ransom is paid, the
                            ransomware operator will either provide a copy of the private key used to protect the
                            symmetric encryption key or a copy of the symmetric encryption key itself. This information
                            can be entered into a decryptor program (also provided by the cybercriminal) that can use it
                            to reverse the encryption and restore access to the user’s files.</p>
                    </li>

                <p>Atlanta's government was hobbled by a ransomware attack in 2018, and wound up costing the city more
                    than $2.6 million to recover from, according to a Wired report.</p>

                    Brian Benczkowski, the head of the criminal division of the Justice Department, said in November.

                <h4 class="titleH4">The Nigerian prince scam is one of the oldest on the internet</h4>

                <p>
                    The Nigerian prince scam is one of the oldest scams on the internet. The scam rose to prominence in the 1990s, and is referred to by the FBI as Nigerian Letter or 419
                    fraud.

                </p>

                <p>The premise is simple: You get an email, and within the message, a Nigerian prince (or investor, or
                    government official) offers you an opportunity for lucrative financial gain.</p>

                <p>The catch? Pay a small portion of the amount up front, or hand over bank account information and
                    other identifying information so that the transfer can be made. Of course, you lose that seed money,
                    never receiving a dime in return.</p>

                <p>According to a 2018 Wired article, the conspiracy has risen in sophistication, netting millions in
                    scam money and minor celebrity status for the Nigerian email schemers who commit the fraud. Its malware and phishing combined with clever social engineering and account takeovers, James Bettke,
                    a counter-threat unit researcher at the security firm Secureworks, told Wired reporter Lily Hay
                    Newman in 2018.</p>

                <p>They are not very technically sophisticated, they can’t code, they don’t do a lot of automation, he
                    added. But their strengths are social engineering and creating agile scams. They spend months
                    sifting through inboxes. They’re quiet and methodical.</p>

            <h3>Popular Ransomware Variants in 2020-2021</h3>
            <nav>
                <ul>
                    <li>1. Ryuk</li>
                    <p>Ryuk is an example of a very targeted ransomware variant. It is commonly delivered via spear
                        phishing emails or by using compromised user credentials to log into enterprise systems using
                        the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP). Once a system is infected, Ryuk encrypts certain types of
                        files (avoiding those crucial to a computer’s operation), then presents a ransom demand.
                    </p>
                    <p>Ryuk is well-known as one of the most expensive types of ransomware in existence. Ryuk demands
                        ransoms that average over $1 million. As a result, the cybercriminals behind Ryuk primarily
                        focus on enterprises that have the resources necessary to meet their demands.</p>

                    <li>2. Maze</li>
                    <p>The Maze ransomware is famous for being the first ransomware variant to combine file encryption
                        and data theft. When targets started refusing to pay ransoms, Maze began collecting sensitive
                        data from victims’ computers before encrypting it. If the ransom demands were not met, this data
                        would be publicly exposed or sold to the highest bidder. The potential for an expensive data
                        breach was used as additional incentive to pay up.
                    </p>
                    <p>The group behind the Maze ransomware has officially ended its operations. However, this does not
                        mean that the threat of ransomware has been reduced. Some Maze affiliates have transitioned to
                        using the Egregor ransomware, and the Egregor, Maze, and Sekhmet variants are believed to have a
                        common source.</p>
                    <li>3. REvil (Sodinokibi)</li>
                    <p>The REvil group (also known as Sodinokibi ) is another ransomware variant that targets large
                        organizations.
                        REvil is one of the most well-known ransomware families on the net. The ransomware group, which
                        has been operated by the Russian-speaking REvil group since 2019, has been responsible for many
                        big breaches such as ‘Kaseya‘ and ‘JBS’
                    </p>
                    <p>It has competed with Ryuk over the last several years for the title of the most expensive
                        ransomware variant. REvil is known to have demanded $800,000 ransom payments.

                        While REvil began as a traditional ransomware variant, it has evolved over time-
                        They are using the Double Extortion technique- to steal data from businesses while also
                        encrypting the files. This means that, in addition to demanding a ransom to decrypt data,
                        attackers might threaten to release the stolen data if a second payment is not made.
                    </p>
                    <li>4. Lockbit</li>
                    <p>LockBit is a data encryption malware in operation since September 2019 and a recent
                        Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS). This piece of ransomware was developed to encrypt large
                        organizations rapidly as a way of preventing its detection quickly by security appliances and
                        IT/SOC teams.
                    </p>
                    <li>5. DearCry</li>
                    <p>In March 2021, Microsoft released patches for four vulnerabilities within Microsoft Exchange
                        servers. DearCry is a new ransomware variant designed to take advantage of four recently
                        disclosed vulnerabilities in Microsoft Exchange

                        The DearCry ransomware encrypts certain types of files. Once the encryption is finished, DearCry
                        will show a ransom message instructing users to send an email to the ransomware operators in
                        order to learn how to decrypt their files.</p>
