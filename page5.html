            <h2>What is Malware/Ransomware? </h2>
            <p>Ransomware is malware designed to deny a user or organization access to files on their computer. By
                encrypting these files and demanding a ransom payment for the decryption key, these malware place
                organizations in a position where paying the ransom is the easiest and cheapest way to regain access to
                their files.

            </p>

                <h3>Approaches: </h3>

                <h4 class="titleH4">Step one: Infection and Distribution Vectors
                </h4>
                <ol class="titleH4">
                    <li style="color:seagreen">
                        <p>Phishing emails: A malicious email may contain a link to a website hosting a malicious
                            download or an attachment that has downloader functionality built in. If the email recipient
                            falls for the phish, then the ransomware is downloaded and executed on their computer.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP). With RDP, an attacker who has stolen or guessed an employee’s
                            login credentials can use them to authenticate to and remotely access a computer within the
                            enterprise network. With this access, the attacker can directly download the malware and
                            execute it on the machine under their control.

                        </p>
                    </li>

                </ol>

                <h4 class="titleH4">Step two: Data Encryption
                </h4>
                <ul class="titleH4">
                    <li>
                        <p> After ransomware has gained access to a system, it can begin encrypting its files. Since
                            encryption functionality is built into an operating system, this simply involves accessing
                            files, encrypting them with an attacker-controlled key, and replacing the originals with the
                            encrypted versions. Most ransomware variants are cautious in their selection of files to
                            encrypt to ensure system stability. Some variants will also take steps to delete backup and
                            shadow copies of files to make recovery without the decryption key more difficult.</p>
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h4 class="titleH4">Step three: Ransom Demand</h4>
                <ul class="titleH4">
                    <li>
                        <p>Once file encryption is complete, the ransomware is prepared to make a ransom demand.
                            Different ransomware variants implement this in numerous ways, but it is not uncommon to
                            have a display background changed to a ransom note or text files placed in each encrypted
                            directory containing the ransom note. Typically, these notes demand a set amount of
                            cryptocurrency in exchange for access to the victim’s files. If the ransom is paid, the
                            ransomware operator will either provide a copy of the private key used to protect the
                            symmetric encryption key or a copy of the symmetric encryption key itself. This information
                            can be entered into a decryptor program (also provided by the cybercriminal) that can use it
                            to reverse the encryption and restore access to the user’s files.</p>

            <h3>Popular Ransomware Variants in 2020-2021</h3>
            <nav>
                <ul>
                    <li>1. Ryuk</li>
                    <p>Ryuk is an example of a very targeted ransomware variant. It is commonly delivered via spear
                        phishing emails or by using compromised user credentials to log into enterprise systems using
                        the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP). Once a system is infected, Ryuk encrypts certain types of
                        files (avoiding those crucial to a computer’s operation), then presents a ransom demand.
                    </p>

                    <li>2. Maze</li>
                    <p>The Maze ransomware is famous for being the first ransomware variant to combine file encryption
                        and data theft. When targets started refusing to pay ransoms, Maze began collecting sensitive
                        data from victims’ computers before encrypting it. If the ransom demands were not met, this data
                        would be publicly exposed or sold to the highest bidder. The potential for an expensive data
                        breach was used as additional incentive to pay up.
                    </p>

                    <li>3. REvil (Sodinokibi)</li>
                    <p>The REvil group (also known as Sodinokibi ) is another ransomware variant that targets large
                        organizations.
                        REvil is one of the most well-known ransomware families on the net. The ransomware group, which
                        has been operated by the Russian-speaking REvil group since 2019, has been responsible for many
                        big breaches such as ‘Kaseya‘ and ‘JBS’
                    </p>
                
                    <li>4. Lockbit</li>
                    <p>LockBit is a data encryption malware in operation since September 2019 and a recent
                        Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS). This piece of ransomware was developed to encrypt large
                        organizations rapidly as a way of preventing its detection quickly by security appliances and
                        IT/SOC teams.
