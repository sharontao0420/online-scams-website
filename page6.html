            <h2>What is Social Engineering? </h2>
            <p>Social engineering is the art of manipulating people so they give up confidential information such as
                passwords or bank information. These scams tend to lure unsuspecting users into exposing data, spreading
                malware infections, or giving access to restricted systems. Criminals use social engineering tactics
                because it is usually easier to exploit your natural inclination to trust than it is to discover ways to
                hack your software. Scams based on social engineering are built around how people think and act. Once an
                attacker understands what motivates a user’s actions, they can deceive and manipulate the user
                effectively. Most social engineering attacks rely on actual communication between attackers and victims.
                The attacker tends to motivate the user into compromising themselves, rather than using brute force
                methods to breach your data.


            </p>

            <p>In addition, hackers try to exploit a user's lack of knowledge. Users may not realize the full value of
                personal data, like their phone number, and how just a few pieces of information can give hackers access
                to multiple networks and accounts. As a result, many users are unsure how to best protect themselves and
                their information. </p>

                <h3>Steps for the social engineering attack:
                </h3>


                <ol class="titleH4">
                    <li style="color:seagreen">
                        <p>Gathering background information on you or a larger group you are a part of.

                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Infiltrate by establishing a relationship or initiating an interaction, started by building
                            trust.


                        </p>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <p>
                            Exploit the victim once trust and a weakness are established to advance the attack.

                        </p>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <p>
                            Disengage once the user has taken the desired action.

                        </p>
                    </li>

                </ol>



                <p> This process can take place in a single email or over months in a series of social media chats. It
                    could even be a face-to-face interaction. But it ultimately concludes with an action you take, like
                    sharing your information or exposing yourself to malware. From there, it's a simple matter to reset
                    passwords and gain almost unlimited access. They can steal money, disperse social engineering
                    malware, and more.</p>



                <p>Time-sensitive opportunities or requests are another reliable tool in an attacker’s arsenal. You may
                    be motivated to compromise yourself under the guise of a serious problem that needs immediate
                    attention. Alternatively, you may be exposed to a prize or reward that may disappear if you do not
                    act quickly. Either approach overrides your critical thinking ability.
